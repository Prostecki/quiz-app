# Quiz App

This web-based quiz application is built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, designed to provide a fun and interactive quiz experience for users.

## Main Features:

- **API-Based Questions**: Fetches random quiz questions from an external API, shuffling answers to ensure variety with each playthrough.
- **Scoreboard**: Users can save their scores along with a nickname, which is stored locally using `localStorage` and displayed on a dynamic scoreboard.
- **Input Validation**: Nicknames are sanitized to only accept letters and numbers, preventing invalid characters.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The app is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Special care is taken to avoid zooming issues on mobile inputs.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations, such as bouncing headers, enhance the user experience.

## Technologies:

- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality.
- **HTML & CSS** for layout and styling.
